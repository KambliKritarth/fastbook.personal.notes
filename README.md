# 01/10/2023 -- Status on Deep Learning progress
Right now I am at the very beginning of my Deep Learning journey. I have chosen Practical DL for Coders by Jeremy Howard as the course to go with. I went ahead with this course as it was branded as a top-down approach towards learning DL(i.e. it promised as a course which would familiarise you with broader concepts first then assumes you to retroactively learn the basics). 
While it has been the case while learning through this course I am also not able to extract the output as I expected as smoothly. I completed the first lesson(in the course) very quickly while I am struggling to get the output for the 2nd lesson(Deployment).
As of 11:33 PM I have got anaconda navigator and Jupyter Lab installed on the system I have currently access to.
